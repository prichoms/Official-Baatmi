Language translator for indic languages 

The Indian Language policy states that the state government can run its daily work on three languages - Hindi, English or Any other constitutionally recognised scheduled language.
The state of Maharashtra is one such state, that covers its officially written documents in its regional language Marathi , in contrast to the  other parts of the country, specially the Hindi belt ( 65% country population), where hindi and english are used.
Moreover, Indic languages are often underrepresented when it comes to language translation.
