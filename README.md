Language translator for indic languages 

# Motivation

The Indian Language policy states that the state government can run its daily work on three languages - Hindi, English or Any other constitutionally recognised scheduled language.
The state of Maharashtra is one such state, that covers its officially written documents in its regional language Marathi , in contrast to the  other parts of the country, specially the Hindi belt ( 65% country population), where hindi and english are used.
Moreover, Indic languages are often underrepresented when it comes to language translation. 

This requires conversion of the central government documents into the regional languages and vice versa whenever the documents/news are exchanged. This work was done through manual translation uptill now. As an example, Tamil Nadu had employed around 1K translators to convert all the central government laws and codes into Tamil language.
Language translation is one of the most tedious tasks when sharing information and in a country as diverse as India, a mechanised approach to do this becomes more necessary.  
Often when manual translation is done, there are chances of mistakes and even the slightest of errors can change the whole meaning. This is where automation saves our skins. 

# Dataset

We have used the samanantar dataset which is probably one of the largest dataset available for indic to indic language translation as of now. 
We will use a part of the dataset combined with our own set of conversions if needed.
